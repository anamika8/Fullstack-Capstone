# Mommy Talks - App
<img src="https://travis-ci.org/anamika8/Mommy-Talks.svg?branch=master">

A place for new, upcoming and experienced mothers to share their concern, get helpful suggestions etc.

## Background
Being a mother myself, and having experienced hardships bringing up my daughter, I always used to wonder if I could seek help from fellow mothers
regarding any concerns I was having that time.
Hence, I would like to present to you all a forum for mothers to share, discuss and debate all questions faced by mothers
around the world.
